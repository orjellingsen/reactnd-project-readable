# Readable - Udacity ReactND Project
In this project I have built a content and comment web app using React and Redux.

Features include:
* Main list view show all posts from all categories
* Filter by categories (React, Redux, Udacity)
* Sort posts by date or score
* Creating new posts as well as updating existing posts
* Click on a post to get a detailed view including comments
* Add comments to a post or update existing comments
* Switch theme to light theme
